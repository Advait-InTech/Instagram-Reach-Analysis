# Instagram Reach Analysis Project

## Introduction
The Instagram Reach Analysis project aims to develop a Python-based tool to analyze the reach and engagement metrics of Instagram posts.

## Objectives
- Develop a Python tool to fetch Instagram post data.
- Calculate reach and engagement metrics for each post.
- Provide visualizations for better understanding of the data.
- Explore trends and patterns in Instagram post performance.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Instagram API (or alternative methods for data retrieval)
- Data visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## Project Structure
The project will consist of the following components:
1. **Data Retrieval Module**: This module will handle fetching data from Instagram, either using the Instagram API or other methods.
2. **Data Processing Module**: This module will process the retrieved data to calculate reach and engagement metrics.
3. **Visualization Module**: Visualizations will be generated to present the analysis results.
4. **Documentation and Reporting**: Documentation will be provided detailing the project, its components, and how to use the tool.

## Milestones
1. Set up project structure and environment.
2. Implement data retrieval module.
3. Develop data processing algorithms.
4. Create visualization components.
5. Testing and debugging.
6. Documentation and reporting.
